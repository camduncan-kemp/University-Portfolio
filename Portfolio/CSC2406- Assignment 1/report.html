        <h1><i>Report</i></h1>
        <p>For this site prototype, I have elected to go for a classic noir style backdrop, dark city skylines, ribbons
            of smoke and contrasting black and white colours. As the primary genre of your company is that of noir-crime
            fiction, I feel that this would be best for presenting a clear message to your visitors for what your
            company is about.</p>
        <p>I have formatted the website so that it retains usability and easy readability when viewed on a wide variety
            of devices, from wide-screened desktops/laptops, to the narrow smart phone screens which are so prevalent in
            our society.</p>
        <p>I have also made sure to make accommodations for giving the website a clean and easy to read look when it is
            printed out physically, a bad print layout can cause quite severe issues for your visitors who may want to
            have a physical copy of the site and make them think twice about giving you their custom.</p>
        <p>Proper accessiblity is extremely important with modern website design, and as such, I have ensured that your
            site is easily readable both by sight and also by screen readers so that visually impaired people can still
            fully appreciate what is contained in your site.
        </p>
        <p>For the purposes of the this prototype, I have populated the example pages with some of my favourite authors,
            while they are not noir-crime authors themselves, using them does demonstrate the design of the website and
            how
            your visitors would experience the site if it was developed into a full public release state.</p>
        <p>I am committed to working with you directly and making sure that this website becomes exactly as you envision
            it, promoting your works to the whole world and introducing countless more people to the joys of the
            noir-crime genre. I believe that my tender for this contract is the most suitable for your company as I will
            work tirelessly to make your company's vision a reality.</p>
