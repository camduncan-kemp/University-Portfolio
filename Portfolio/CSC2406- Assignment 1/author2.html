                alt="Portait of the author, Benjamin 'Yahtzee' Croshaw"></p>
        <p>Born in the town of Rugby in Warwickshire, England on 24th May 1983, Benjamin 'Yahtzee' Croshaw is best known
            for his hit web-series 'Zero Punctuation' for the Escapist,
            as well as his solo-made video games including the Lovecraftian-influenced Chzo Mythos series.
        </p>
        <p>For most of his life, he longed to become a published novellist, which he achieved in 2008 with his popular
            debut novel, <i>Mogworld</i>. In the years since <i>Mogworld</i> was first published
            Yahtzee has followed on with three separate novels; <i>Jam</i>, <i>Will Save The Galaxy for Food</i> and
            <i>Differently Morphous</i>.
        </p>
        <p>Yahtzee has stated this his biggest literary influences include H.P. Lovecraft, Terry Pratchett and Douglas
            Adams. This gives him a uniquely dark, macabre but also highly comedic style in his writing.</p>
        <h1><i>Mogworld</i></h1>
        <p><img src="mogworld.png" style="width:13em; height:13em" alt="Front cover of 'Mogworld'"></p>
        <p>Imagine slogging through life as the son of a peasant pig farmer, working your way into one of the land's
            least respected Mage academies and then finally falling into the serene, peaceful
            and loving embrace of death in defence of it.....only for some burke to bring you back to life again.
        </p>
        <p>Mogworld tells the story of Jim, a poorly educated Mage whose mortal status has been made aggravatingly
            ambiguous by dark forces. As Jim endlessly tries to correct this ambiguity
            and return to the paradise of the afterlife he had so briefly been able to enjoy, fate puts him on a path to
            discover just what forces are behind his newfound immortality and
            meddling with the world he once knew.</p>
        <h1><i>Jam</i></h1>
        <p><img src="jam.png" style="width:13em; height:13em" alt="Front cover of 'Jam'"></p>
        <p>The city of Brisbane has seen it's fair share of floods over the years, although they have mostly been rather
            dull as they only involved water instead of man-eating jam.</p>
        <p>The novel follows a group of housemates as they attempt to navigate their way through post-jam Brisbane to
            find a way out of the city. On their way they encounter everything from not-so
            secret government agents, ironic cultists and not to mention, the seemingly sentient man-eating jam that has
            flooded the city.
        </p>
        <h1><i>Will Save The Galaxy For Food</i></h1>
        <p><img src="galaxyforfood.jpg" style="width:13em; height:13em"
                alt="Front cover of 'Will Save The Galaxy For Food'"></p>
        <p>The life of a daring star pilot is filled with endless adventure and peril.....until some smart-arse git goes
            and
            invents quantum teleportation</p>
        <p>In a universe where space travel has been rendered obsolute with instant quantum tunneling transportation,
            once heroic star pilots are forced to do whatever it takes to survive,
            whether it is acting as renegade pirates or taking dullard tourists on sight-seeing tours.
        </p>
        <p><i>Will Save The Galaxy For Food</i> follows the mishap of one such redundant former star pilot who in trying
            to
            make a quick buck, ends up angering a psychotic cassowary talon wielding mobster, which is of course one of
            the worse
            mobsters to aggravate. As he tries his best to save his skin, it soon becomes evident that his star pilot
            skills maybe
            more necessary than he expected.</p>
        <h1><i>Differently Morphous</i></h1>
        <p><img src="morphous.jpg" style="width:13em; height:13em" alt="Front cover of 'Differently Morphous'"></p>
        <p>When the secrets of magic and other-worldly creatures are accidentally exposed to the public in today's
            social media
            filled world, the Ministry of Occultism must learn to adjust to the public relations and public scrutiny of
            the modern age.
        </p>
        <p>As a serial killer appears to be targeting the gelatinous creatures that have been welcomed into society, it
            is up to a group of
            agents from the Ministry of Occultism to track down this killer before they get buried under an avalanche of
            negative Twitter hashtags and
            bashing from the government.
